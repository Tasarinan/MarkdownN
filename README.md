# DockWriter #


DockWriter is a full-featured,open-source  dockable writer based on PageDown. It is built with [Nodejs](nodejs.org "NodeJS Homepage") and runs within [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

It was also very quick to write and lets me add in [features](#Features) that I want, most of which have to do with writing small snippets of JavaScript to manipulate data and see how it works.

## Features
1. **Multiple Formats**: Supports both [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)

2. **Easy to find files**: Double-click on the file name in the tab and an Explorer/Finder window will appear with the file selected.

3. **Global Shortcut**: For an easy way to return back to DockWriter, just press `CTRL + F12` (or `CMD + F12` on a Mac) to bring the DockWriter window to focus and on top of all windows.

4. **Distraction-Free Writing**: You can toggle full screen mode by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + F` and toggle auto-hide of the menu by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + M`.

5. **Save As HTML**: From the `File` menu you can select to save your current document as HTML or you can use the `CTRL + SHIFT + H` shortcut.


## Setting Up and Running

Right now getting DockWriter up and running should be as simple as installing [node](https://nodejs.org/) and then running `npm install` followed by either `npm run win` (if on Windows) or `npm run mac` if on OS X.
